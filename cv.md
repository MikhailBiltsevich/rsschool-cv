>I'm going to be a Frontend-Developer! For this goal I use almost all freetime for self-education.

## Skills

I learnt programming at university. I've learnt HTML/CSS/JS, .NET (C#), Android, Python, C, C++ and Assembler.

**There is my latest code example**

`String.prototype.isWord = function() {
  let regexp = /^[a-z]+$/i;
  return regexp.test(this);
}`

## Experience and education

I haven't got any commercial experience in development, but I've succesfully completed a 144-hour General English Course at Elementary level. As result I've got CEFR Level A2 in English. Also I get education at Udemy course "Web-development in 2020".
